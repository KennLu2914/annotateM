##  annotateM
=========

Have you been having problems annotating your genome? 
Confused on which annotation program to use? 
Why are the annotations different using different programs?
The ORFs are called differently and why are there more ORFs called in this program than the other?
Would you like to have a unified automated annotation pipeline that searches against the currently existing databases
like IMG, Uniref, COG, Pfam, TIGRfam?

If yes is your answer to any of these questions? 

Try annotateM.

**Dependencies:**
1. prokka
2. blast
3. hmmer
4. Pfam_scan
5. contig_extractor
6. parallel

**Database files:**
1. IMG
2. Uniref90
3. COG
4. Pfam
5. TIGRfam

In the near future, we will be adding more databases for searching, including RAST and KEGG.
Would you like to make the program better? Feel free to do so and don't forget to git push afterwards.
