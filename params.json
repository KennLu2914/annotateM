Pfam_scan\r\n5. contig_extractor\r\n6. parallel\r\n\r\n**Database files:**\r\n1. IMG\r\n2. Uniref90\r\n3. COG\r\n4. Pfam\r\n5. TIGRfam\r\n\r\nIn the near future, we will be adding more databases for searching, including RAST and KEGG.\r\nWould you like to make the program better? Feel free to do so and don't forget to git push afterwards.\r\n\r\nQueries here on github or at fauziharoon[at_symbol]gmail.com\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
